## Introduction

A simple and flexible React package for authenticating your React application using [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum#introduction).

- Effortless integration of Laravel Sanctum authentication in your React app
- Built-in support for email verification with [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze-installation)
- Minimal dependencies — only requires [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- Simplifies the creation of protected routes

## Installation

Install from NPM

```
npm i react-laravel-sanctum
```

## Usage

Wrap your react application in a `<AuthProvider>` component

```js
import React from "react";
import { AuthProvider } from "react-laravel-sanctum";
import { axios } from "axios";
const authConfig = {
  axiosInstance: axios,
  signInRoute: "/login",
  authenticationCheckRoute: "/auth-check",
  signOutRoute: "/logout",
};

const App = () => (
  <AuthProvider config={authConfig}>/* Your application code */</AuthProvider>
);
```

You can then use the `useAuth()` hook to access authentication and verification status, user data, and other related methods in any component wrapped by the `<AuthProvider>` component.

```js
import { useAuth } from "react-laravel-sanctum";

const LoginForm = () => {
  const { signIn } = useAuth();

  const handleLogin = () => {
    const credentials = {
      email: "username@example.com",
      password: "example",
    };

    signIn(credentials)
      .then(({ mustVerifyEmail }) => {
        if (mustVerifyEmail) {
          console.log("Must Verify Email Message");
        }
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log("Error Message");
      });
  };

  return <button onClick={() => handleLogin()}>Login</button>;
};
```

```js
import { useAuth } from "react-laravel-sanctum";

const UserComponent = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  return <div>Hello {user?.first_name}</div>;
};
```

## Methods & Properties Available with `useAuth()`

The `useAuth` hook gives you access to the `AuthContext`.

|                           | Description                                                                                                                                                   |

## Config Setup

Not all URLS in the config are required. These need to be defined in your Laravel application.

```js
const authConfig = {
  // An axiosInstance is required to be used by react-laravel-sanctum.
  axiosInstance: AxiosInstance;
  /*
  * Required
  * Sends a POST request to this endpoint to log in the user.
  */
  signInRoute: "/login";
  /*
  * Optional (unless signUp() will be used)
  * Sends a POST request to this endpoint to register the user.
  */
  signUpRoute: "/register";
  /*
  * Required
  * Sends a GET request to this endpoint to this endpoint to check the user authentication status.
  * Returns a user object that is represented as `user` in the React application.
  */
  authenticationCheckRoute: "/auth-check";
  /*
  * Optional (unless sendEmailVerification() will be used)
  * Sends a POST request to this endpoint to send an email verification notification.
  */
  sendEmailVerificationRoute: "/verification-notification";
  /*
  * Optional (unless verifyEmail() will be used)
  * Sends a GET request to this endpoint to verify the user.
  */
  verifyEmailRoute: (id: string, hash: string, expires: string, signature: string) => `/verify-email/${id}/${hash}?expires=${expires}&signature=${signature}`;
  /*
  * Required
  * Sends a POST request to this endpoint to logout the user.
  */
  signOutRoute: '/logout';
};
```

react-laravel-sanctum automatically checks if the user is signed in when the `<AuthProvider>` component is mounted. By default, it also assumes `emailVerification` is set to `true` and will check if the user’s email is verified. If you’d like to disable this behavior, simply set emailVerification to `false` like this:

```js
<AuthProvider config={authConfig} emailVerification={false}>
```

Similarly, `onInitCheck` is set to `false` by default. When set to `true`, it checks if the user is authenticated when `<AuthProvider>` mounts. If you would like to enable this behavior, set `onInitCheck` to `true` like this:

```js
<AuthProvider config={authConfig} onInitCheck={true}>
```

## Handling Session Timeout

This function updates the authentication state in the event that the user's session has timed out. It is particularly useful when implementing protected routes, as it ensures that users are redirected or logged out when their session expires.

```js
const { handleSessionTimeout } = useAuth();

axiosInstance
  .get("/protected-resource")
  .then((response) => {
    // handle successful response
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle session timeout error
    handleSessionTimeout(error);
  });
```

## Email Verification

This package supports email verification using Laravel Breeze out of the box.

1. Install Laravel Breeze as an API using the following instructions https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze-installation

2. Ensure the User Model implements `MustVerifyEmail` interface.

Example for implementation:

This is the `<SignUpForm> Component`:

```js
import { useAuth } from "react-laravel-sanctum";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const SignUpForm = () => {
  const { signUp } = useAuth();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleRegistration = () => {
    const credentials = {
      name: "user",
      email: "username@example.com",
      password: "example",
    };

    signUp(credentials)
      .then(({ mustVerifyEmail }) => {
        if (mustVerifyEmail) {
          navigate("Email verification notification component"); // to allow users to resend the email verification notification
        }
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log("Error Message");
      });
  };

  return <button onClick={() => handleRegistration()}>SignUp</button>;
};
```

This is the `<EmailVerificationProcessing> Component`, The URL is obtained from the verification email sent to the user:

```js
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useAuth } from "react-laravel-sanctum";
import { useLocation, useParams } from "react-router-dom";

const EmailVerificationProcessing = () => {
  const { verifyEmail } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = "example";
    const hash = "example";
    const expires = "example";
    const signature = "example";

    verifyEmail(id, hash, expires, signature).catch((error) => {
      console.log(error);
    });
  }, []);

  return <div>Verifying....</div>;
};
```

## Axios

react-laravel-sanctum assumes that setting the CSRF token is handled within the provided Axios instance. This is done through request interceptors, allowing users to fully control their own interceptor implementations and customize their Axios instance configuration.
